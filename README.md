# Node_Scrape_App

Node News Scrapper

In this assignment you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. You wont be writing any articles; instead, you'll use Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape the news.


Instructions

Create an app that accomplishes the following:

Whenever a user visits your site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of your choice and display them for the user. Each scraped article should be saved to your application database. 

Headline - the title of the article

Summary - a short summary of the article

URL - the url to the original article
